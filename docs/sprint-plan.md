# 🏁 Move-In Sprint Plan

This document outlines the development tasks for the current sprint.
The goal is to coordinate frontend, backend, database, and documentation efforts.

---
## 📅 Sprint Duration
**Sprint Lengthw** 1–2 weeks  
**Objective:** Establish core system foundation and prepare integration between frontend and backend.

---

## 👥 Team Roles

| Ari -  Frontend (Landing + Core UI) |
| Suthan - Database Management (PostgreSQL, Schemas) |
| Ayesha - Backend Services (Express Microservices) |
| Sofiia - Design & Documentation (API Routing + Sprint Docs) |
| Lakshay - DevOps & Full-Stack Coordination |

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goals
1. Frontend base screens implemented
2. Backend service skeletons created
3. Database schemas prepared
4. API route definitions documented
5. UI design system finalized
6. Vendor Dashboard feature spec completed

---

## 🧩 Task Breakdown

### 🖥 Frontend (Ari)
- Create landing page UI
- Build core layout structure
- Prepare routing structure
- Use mock data for now

---

### 🗄 Database (Suthan)
- Design PostgreSQL schemas
- Create tables for:
    - Users
    - Vendors
    - Listings
    - Bookings
- Prepare migrations

---

### ⚙ Backend (Ayesha)
- Setup Express microservices
- Configure gateway routing
- Implement basic auth structure
- Create placeholder endpoints

---

### 🎨 Design & Documentation (Sofia)
- Define API endpoints and routing structure
- Write feature documentation (Vendor Dashboard)
- Create UI design system
- Maintain sprint documentation
- Ensure integration alignment between frontend and backend

---

### 🐳 DevOps (Lakshay)
- Setup Docker environment
- Ensure PostgreSQL runs in container
- Coordinate integration
- Support teammates with environment issues

---

## 🔌 Integration Plan
- Frontend will initially use mock data
- Backend services prepared to match documented API routes
- DB schemas ready before full backend implementation
- Sofia’s API documentation used as reference for integration

---
## 🚧 Risks & Consideratiions
- Backend and frontend must follow the same route definitions
- Database must be ready before backend logic
- Design consistency maintained through UI Design System
---

## Sprint Completion Criteria
Sprint is considered complete when:
- All core screens exist in frontend
- Backend service skeletons run
- Database schemas created
- API routes documented
- Documentation folder up to date
